# 20 Time Project
Location to log 20Time work and learning.  This readme should be updated as a log file for the project, and any data files (if necessary) should be found within the repo.  
  
## Topic
* Create a website,  where youth football coaches (like me) can go to and use to build their playbook! The website will provide 
 templates, completed examples, and other bonus tools that coaches will need to create a successful playbook. Will use HTML to make the website, and JS to make it interactif. The website will be styled with CSS. I would like to add templates for play-calling cards or sheets as well, since those are useful for coaches too, but I'm not sure yet if that is doable, will have to see as I progress through the project. Ideally, if all goes well and smoothly and I have more time at the end, I would like to add a section on the website that has drills for kids (for different positions) that coaches could use as well.

#### Week 1 Log (September 18th - 22nd)
* Goal: Focus on learning HTML to prepare for building the playbook template website.
* Completed: Watched all of the tutorial videos in Intro to HTML on Khan Academy. Completed 4 projects on HTML. Now able to
start working on the website. I posted my idea into Google Classroom for the class to see.
