# 20 Time Project
Location to log 20Time work and learning.  This readme should be updated as a log file for the project, and any data files (if necessary) should be found within the repo.  
  
## Topic
* Create a website,  where youth football coaches (like me) can go to and use to build their playbook! The website will provide 
 templates, completed examples, and other bonus tools that coaches will need to create a successful playbook. Will use HTML to make the website, and JS to make it interactif. The website will be styled with CSS. I would like to add templates for play-calling cards or sheets as well, since those are useful for coaches too, but I'm not sure yet if that is doable, will have to see as I progress through the project. Ideally, if all goes well and smoothly and I have more time at the end, I would like to add a section on the website that has drills for kids (for different positions) that coaches could use as well.

#### Week 1 Log (September 18th - 22nd)
* Goal: Focus on learning HTML to prepare for building the playbook template website.
* Completed: Watched all of the tutorial videos in Intro to HTML on Khan Academy. Completed 4 projects on HTML. Now able to
start working on the website. I posted my idea into Google Classroom for the class to see.

#### Week 2 (September 25th - 29th)
* Goal: Create some templates (on a Google Docs or something), and get the base website started.
* Completed: Finished making 1 template. Also watched tutorial videos on how to build a website from scratch (I want to make it myself isntead of using something like Wix), and got started on making it! Created an index.html file (added some text), and I started some styling by creating a style.css file. Got a base website going! Good progress made.

#### Week 3 (October 2nd - 6th)
* Completed: Finished another template for the playbook on google docs. Learned how to position objects around the website by watching tutorial videos, so that I can place my text and images around the website where I choose. Watched tutorials on creating interactive websites. Researched website templates to determine how I should make my website look.

#### Week 4 (October 9th-13th)
* Completed: Did some more research on web-design, specifically sports themed websites. I finalized my decision for what I would be including in my website. I also worked on designing some more templates on Google Docs.
