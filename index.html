<h2> Drills </h2>
<p>
  In this section, we'll display an overview of our top drills for a variety of positions.
  For each drill, we will give explanations of the drills, safety tips, and coaching points.
</p>
<h4> Offence </h4>
<h5></h5>
<p> </p>
<h4> Defence </h4>
<h5> The Square </h5>
<p>Set up 4 cones to form a 10 yard by 10 yard square. Have all players start behind Cone 1.
One at a time, have the players backpedal to Cone 2. Then, they perform a sharp cut and
side shuffel to cone 3. Next, they sprint forwards full-speed to cone 4. Finally, they side shuffel
back to cone 1, and go to the end of the line.</p>
<p>This drill is all about footwork and sharp cuts. As a defensive back or linebacker, lateral movement
  and the ability to adjust your course is key. Make sure that coaches who run this drill are able
  to explain the importance of quickness to the kids, and emphasize it throughout the drill.
</p>
<p> When setting up this drill, it is important to check for safety hazards in the area.
  Remove any thing that the players could trip on, and do not set up near any pot holes or
  landscape dangers.
</p>
<h5> Shadow the Ball </h5>
<p>Have four to five players line up in a horizontal line about 10 yards in front of the coach.
The coach must have a football for this drill. Have the kids start by chopping their feet (quick movements
on their tip-toes). The coach then points the ball in different directions (front, back, sideways, diagonal),
and the players must respond by backpedalling, sideshuffling, or sprinting to the direction where the coach
is pointing. After changing directions a handful of times, the coach yells ball and throws the ball into the  air.
The players must compete to catch the ball.</p>
<p> The key here is reaction time. This drill helps a ton with coverage, and teaches the kids to watch the
QB, and follow their receiver with speed and accuracy. Teach the players about the importance of reaction
time in coverage. When pointing the ball diagonally, have the kids always stay looking at the QB, and
backpedal diagonally while always looking forward at the coach by opening their hips in either direction.</p>
<p> When setting up this drill, it is important to check for safety hazards in the area.
  Remove any thing that the players could trip on, and do not set up near any pot holes or
  landscape dangers. Make sure this drill does not take place near any other drills or poles.
