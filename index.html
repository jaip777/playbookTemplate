      <p>Take a look around our site, and explore our different sections, including
        drills for the offense, defense, and drills that involve both. Our drills
        have been developped alongside ex CFL Pro Players, and have been used at
        many different levels in youth football!</p>

<h2> Drills </h2>
<p>
  Here we'll display an overview of our top drills for a variety of positions.
  For each drill, we will give explanations of the drills, coaching points, and safety warnings.
  We also provide a diagram showing how the drill should be set up and run for each drill.
</p>

<h4> Offence </h4>
<h5> Footwork Box </h5>
<p> </p>
<h5> Ball Security Gauntlet </h5>
<p> </p>
<h4> Defence </h4>

<div id = "square">
<h5> The Square </h5>

<p>Set up 4 cones to form a 10 yard by 10 yard square. Have all players start behind Cone 1.
One at a time, have the players backpedal to Cone 2. Then, they perform a sharp cut and
side shuffel to cone 3. Next, they sprint forwards full-speed to cone 4. Finally, they side shuffel
back to cone 1, and go to the end of the line.</p>

<p>This drill is all about footwork and sharp cuts. As a defensive back or linebacker, lateral movement
and the ability to adjust your course is key. Make sure that coaches who run this drill are able
to explain the importance of quickness to the kids, and emphasize it throughout the drill.
</p>

<p> When setting up this drill, it is important to check for safety hazards in the area.
  Remove any thing that the players could trip on, and do not set up near any pot holes or
  landscape dangers.
</p>

<div id = "shadow">
<h5> Shadow the Ball </h5>
<p>Have four to five players line up in a horizontal line about 10 yards in front of the coach.
The coach must have a football for this drill. Have the kids start by chopping their feet (quick movements
on their tip-toes). The coach then points the ball in different directions (front, back, sideways, diagonal),
and the players must respond by backpedalling, sideshuffling, or sprinting to the direction where the coach
is pointing. After changing directions a handful of times, the coach yells ball and throws the ball into the  air.
The players must compete to catch the ball.</p>
<p> The key here is reaction time. This drill helps a ton with coverage, and teaches the kids to watch the
QB, and follow their receiver with speed and accuracy. Teach the players about the importance of reaction
time in coverage. When pointing the ball diagonally, have the kids always stay looking at the QB, and
backpedal diagonally while always looking forward at the coach by opening their hips in either direction.</p>
<p> When setting up this drill, it is important to check for safety hazards in the area.
  Remove any thing that the players could trip on, and do not set up near any pot holes or
  landscape dangers. Make sure this drill does not take place near any other drills or poles.
</p>

<div id = "tip">
<h5> Tip Drill </h5>
<p>Have one player stand 10 yards in front of the coach. Have a second player stand two yards behind the first
player. The coach gently lobs the ball up over the head of the first player, who hits it upwards to either side
(like a volley in volleyball) and the player behind has to react and catch the tipped ball before it hits the
ground. Then, the players rotate to the back of the line.</p>
<p>For a coaching point here, explain the importance of the drill to the kids. This drill is for coverage
purposes, to teach the kids to always keep your eye on the ball, and that the play is not over until the ball hits
the ground. If the players are struggling, start with light tips and then proceed to have them tip the ball higher
and further. </p>
<p>The importance for safety in this  drill is, once again, clearing the general area of all hazards on the ground.</p>

<div id = "trophy">
<h5> Trophy Ball </h5>
<p>Place two cones, 10 yards apart. Place a football on one of the cones. Have one player line up in between the
two cones, and another player on the cone without the ball. On the whistle, have the player at the cone try to get to
the football, while the other player in between the cones has to block the player to keep him away from the football.
After about 20 seconds, if the player has not gotten the ball, end the drill, and rotate two new players in.</p>
<p>This drill is great for every defensive position. It is all about shedding blocks, which is a technique that every
  player needs to know. Enforce proper block-shedding techniques (swim, bat the arms, spin, etc.) and teach the players
  about when they would need to shed blocks (shed the O-Line, shed the receiver on sweeps, etc.)</p>
<p> Important safety hazards here not only include removing hazards on the ground, but also proper blocking techniques.
Go over how to properly block, and make sure the players are not blocking too high close to the kneck, or too low at the
knees and ankles. This is a 1v1 drill, so pair players up so that they are similar in size, strength, and experience.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div id = "bull">
<h5> Bull in the ring </h5>
<p>Create a ring with cones. The ring should have a diameter of 5 yards. This is a 1v1 drill, and the objective is to push
the other player out of the ring, like sumo-wrestling. With this drills, kids can only push the other players out, not tackle
or pull. They have to keep their hands on the opponents' chest, they can't push too high or too low. Once a player has been pushed
out of the ring, or the drill has gone on for more than 15 seconds or so, stop the drill and rotate players.</p>
<p> This drill is about strength, but not just arm strength. Teach the players about the importance of core strength and
  using their leg muscles to beat their opponent. Have the players continously be chopping their feet and staying on the balls
  of their feet to avoid getting caught flat-footed and knocked over. This drill can be used for any position.</p>
<p>For safety, remove all hazards from the area, and don't do this drill near a post or pole. It is important that players
  are matched up by size and strength, and a coach must ALWAYS be watching this  drill, ready to blow the whistle if things
  get dangerous. It is easy for players to get hurt if things go wrong, always make sure that they are using safe and
  proper technique. This drill does take a toll on the kids, do not do the drill for too long. Let each player have 3 or 4 reps max,
  and don't do this drill more than once a week.</p>

<h4> Competitive Drills </h4>
<div id = "oklahoma">
<h5> Oklahoma </h5>
  <p> Set up this drill according to the diagram on the right. Create an enclosing with long tackling pads, about 5 yards apart. Between
  the two sets of pads, have two offensive linemen line up in front of two defensive linemen. 3-4 yards behind the D-Linemen, have a
  linebacker or defensive back line up. Behind the O-linemen, have a receiver or running back lineup with a football. One coach must
  stand to the side of the pads, holding a football between the O and D Line. When the coach snaps the ball, the O-Linemen must make a
  hole for the RB/WR who will try to get through to the other side by running through the hole. The D-Linemen and LB/DB must try to bring
  the ball-carrier down before he gets out to the open space. </p>
  <p> This drill is good for all four positions involved. Ensure to add coaching points about what the players need to do to contribute to
  the success of their side of the ball. Make sure that the Linemen have proper stances, and this is a great time to teach about how to
  explode out of a stance properly, and things such as hand positioning and leg power. This is also good practice for the D-Linemen to
  react to the ball being snapped, and to stay onside. Teach the WR/RB to read for holes made by the O-Line, and to hold on to the
  ball while they run through the 'tunnel'. Lastly, teach the DB/LB about lateral movement to cut off the ball-carrier and to tackle low.
  Since there are three defensive players, this is a good time to teach about gang tackling. Feel free to have WR/RBs and DB/LBs play as
  linemen to learn about blocking/shedding, just make sure they are against players of the same size. </p>
  <p> This is a heavy contact drill. Don't run it for too long or too frequently to prevent injury. Make sure everyone is using safe tackling and blocking
    techniques to avoid injury. Also make sure everyone is up against players of the same size as them, or similar. Give frequent water
    breaks if needed.</p>

<div id = "moneyball">
  <h5> Money-Ball </h5>
  <p> This is a drill for runnning backs/ wide receivers and defensive backs and linebackers. Set up the drill according to the diagram
  on the left. Have four defensive players line up between their pair of cones. Have four offensive players line up behind their cones,
  each with a ball. Out of the vision of the defensive players, hand two of the ball carriers a penny to hold in their hand.
  On the whistle, the offensive players must make it to the back set of cones without getting tackled (staying in bounds), while the defensive players
  must try to tackle all four of them before they reach the end. For every offensive player with a coin that gets to the finish without
  getting tackled gets a point for the offense. For every tackle that the defense makes on a player with the coin, they get a point for the
  defense. Since the defense doesn't know who has a penny, they must try to tackle all four RB/WRs. </p>
  <p>For the offense, this is a great drill to teach to break and evade tackles, so teach players proper blocking techniques before running the
  drill. For the defense, this is a great drill to teach them to communicate (call their man, call swaps, etc.) and open field tackling. For the defense,
  teach the kids about pursuit and contain positioning.</p>
  <p>Once again, clear the area of hazards. To reduce chance of injury, match players up by skill, and make sure that there is enough space for
    this drill to be run properly.</p>

<div id = "coverage">
  <h5> 2v2  Coverage </h5>
    <p> This drill is for Wide Receivers, Quarterbacks, and Defensive Backs (also safeties and linebackers depending on their roles in your system). Have
        a QB stand with a line of receivers behind him, with the DBs in a line to the side. The QB will call up two WRs and tell them their pattern, and
        call cadence to start the play. Then, two DBs line up in front of the receivers and have to cover them like an in-game scenario.</p>
    <p> This is a fast paced drill, so every player should get lots of reps. Make sure that they get water breaks as necessary. For the WRs, this is a
        perfect opportunity to teach them about running sharp patterns, quick cuts, and making space between them and the DB. For the DBs, this is a
        drill to teach them about the importance of staying low in their back-pedal, and when to stop back-pedalling and start running forwards.
        Teach players about the cushion that they must keep between them and the receiver, and that once that cushion is broken, they must turn and open
        their hips. Teach them to keep their head on a swivvle between their WR and the QB, and to watch the WR's hips to know where he is going. Teach them
        about hints and cues for them to know when the ball is being thrown (checking to see when the WR's eyes get big), and to communicate with the other
        DB (call ball, call swap, etc.). Lastly, the DBs can experiment with different coverage techniques; man coverage, zone, jam, etc..</p>
    <p> Clear the area of all hazards, do this drill away from poles or other stations. The coach can choose if the players should tackle if the ball is
          caught, or if they should just do two hand touch.</p>
