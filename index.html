<h2> Drills </h2>
<p>
  In this section, we'll display an overview of our top drills for a variety of positions.
  For each drill, we will give explanations of the drills, safety tips, and coaching points.
</p>
<h4> Offence </h4>
<h5></h5>
<p> </p>
<h4> Defence </h4>
<div id = "square">
<h5> The Square </h5>

<p>Set up 4 cones to form a 10 yard by 10 yard square. Have all players start behind Cone 1.
One at a time, have the players backpedal to Cone 2. Then, they perform a sharp cut and
side shuffel to cone 3. Next, they sprint forwards full-speed to cone 4. Finally, they side shuffel
back to cone 1, and go to the end of the line.</p>
<p>This drill is all about footwork and sharp cuts. As a defensive back or linebacker, lateral movement
  and the ability to adjust your course is key. Make sure that coaches who run this drill are able
  to explain the importance of quickness to the kids, and emphasize it throughout the drill.
</p>
<p> When setting up this drill, it is important to check for safety hazards in the area.
  Remove any thing that the players could trip on, and do not set up near any pot holes or
  landscape dangers.
</p>
</div>
<div id = "shadow">
<h5> Shadow the Ball </h5>
<p>Have four to five players line up in a horizontal line about 10 yards in front of the coach.
The coach must have a football for this drill. Have the kids start by chopping their feet (quick movements
on their tip-toes). The coach then points the ball in different directions (front, back, sideways, diagonal),
and the players must respond by backpedalling, sideshuffling, or sprinting to the direction where the coach
is pointing. After changing directions a handful of times, the coach yells ball and throws the ball into the  air.
The players must compete to catch the ball.</p>
<p> The key here is reaction time. This drill helps a ton with coverage, and teaches the kids to watch the
QB, and follow their receiver with speed and accuracy. Teach the players about the importance of reaction
time in coverage. When pointing the ball diagonally, have the kids always stay looking at the QB, and
backpedal diagonally while always looking forward at the coach by opening their hips in either direction.</p>
<p> When setting up this drill, it is important to check for safety hazards in the area.
  Remove any thing that the players could trip on, and do not set up near any pot holes or
  landscape dangers. Make sure this drill does not take place near any other drills or poles.
</p>
</div>
<div id = "tip">
<h5> Tip Drill </h5>
<p>Have one player stand 10 yards in front of the coach. Have a second player stand two yards behind the first
player. The coach gently lobs the ball up over the head of the first player, who hits it upwards to either side
(like a volley in volleyball) and the player behind has to react and catch the tipped ball before it hits the
ground. Then, the players rotate to the back of the line.</p>
<p>For a coaching point here, explain the importance of the drill to the kids. This drill is for coverage
purposes, to teach the kids to always keep your eye on the ball, and that the play is not over until the ball hits
the ground. If the players are struggling, start with light tips and then proceed to have them tip the ball higher
and further. </p>
<p>The importance for safety in this  drill is, once again, clearing the general area of all hazards on the ground.</p>
</div>
<div id = "trophy">
<h5> Trophy Ball </h5>
<p>Place two cones, 10 yards apart. Place a football on one of the cones. Have one player line up in between the
two cones, and another player on the cone without the ball. On the whistle, have the player at the cone try to get to
the football, while the other player in between the cones has to block the player to keep him away from the football.
After about 20 seconds, if the player has not gotten the ball, end the drill, and rotate two new players in.</p>
<p>This drill is great for every defensive position. It is all about shedding blocks, which is a technique that every
  player needs to know. Enforce proper block-shedding techniques (swim, bat the arms, spin, etc.) and teach the players
  about when they would need to shed blocks (shed the O-Line, shed the receiver on sweeps, etc.)</p>
<p> Important safety hazards here not only include removing hazards on the ground, but also proper blocking techniques.
Go over how to properly block, and make sure the players are not blocking too high close to the kneck, or too low at the
knees and ankles. This is a 1v1 drill, so pair players up so that they are similar in size, strength, and experience.</p>
</div>
<div id = "bull">
<h5> Bull in the ring </h5>
<p>Create a ring with cones. The ring should have a diameter of 5 yards. This is a 1v1 drill, and the objective is to push
the other player out of the ring, like sumo-wrestling. With this drills, kids can only push the other players out, not tackle
or pull. They have to keep their hands on the opponents' chest, they can't push too high or too low. Once a player has been pushed
out of the ring, or the drill has gone on for more than 15 seconds or so, stop the drill and rotate players.</p>
<p> This drill is about strength, but not just arm strength. Teach the players about the importance of core strength and
  using their leg muscles to beat their opponent. Have the players continously be chopping their feet and staying on the balls
  of their feet to avoid getting caught flat-footed and knocked over. This drill can be used for any position.</p>
<p>For safety, remove all hazards from the area, and don't do this drill near a post or pole. It is important that players
  are matched up by size and strength, and a coach must ALWAYS be watching this  drill, ready to blow the whistle if things
  get dangerous. It is easy for players to get hurt if things go wrong, always make sure that they are using safe and
  proper technique. This drill does take a toll on the kids, do not do the drill for too long. Let each player have 3 or 4 reps max,
  and don't do this drill more than once a week.</p>
